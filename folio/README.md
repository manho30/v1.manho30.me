## ASCII
ASCII stands for the "American Standard 
Code for Information Interchange".

It was designed in the early 60's, as a standard 
character set for computers and electronic devices.

ASCII is a 7-bit character set containing 128 characters.

It contains the numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower case 
English letters from A to Z, and some special characters.

The character sets used in modern computers, 
in HTML, and on the Internet, are all based on ASCII.

The following tables list the 128 ASCII characters
and their equivalent number.


## EBCDIC

EBCDIC, in full extended binary-coded decimal interchange code, data-encoding system, developed by IBM and used mostly on its computers, that uses a unique eight-bit binary code for each number and alphabetic character as well as punctuation marks and accented letters and nonalphabetic characters.

## Unicode
The Unicode Consortium develops the Unicode Standard. Their goal is to replace the existing character sets with its standard Unicode Transformation Format (UTF).

The Unicode Standard has become a success and is implemented in HTML, XML, Java, JavaScript, E-mail, ASP, PHP, etc. The Unicode standard is also supported in many operating systems and all modern browsers.

The Unicode Consortium cooperates with the leading standards development organizations, like ISO, W3C, and ECMA.

**Tip**: The first 128 characters of Unicode (which correspond one-to-one with ASCII) are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII, making valid ASCII text valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well.


## Relationship
The difference between the two is the number of bits that they use to represent each character. EBCDIC uses 8 bits per character while the original ASCII standard only used 7, due to concerns that using 8 bits for characters that can be represented with 7 is much less efficient.


ASCII has its equivalent in Unicode. The difference between ASCII and Unicode is that ASCII represents lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0-9) and symbols such as punctuation marks while Unicode represents letters of English, Arabic, Greek etc.
